    <p>Scientists in the field of color psychology observe how different colors have different meanings, connotations, and psychological effects. </p>
	  
	 <p>Color psychology is the study of how colors affect perceptions and behaviors. In marketing and branding it is focused on how colors impact consumers impressions of a brand and whether or not they persuade consumers to consider specific brands or make a purchase. Different colors have different meanings, connotations, and psychological effects that vary across different cultures. Color psychology involves the use of color theory; the practical application of mixing and matching various color shades to explore concepts like perception and the effect of different combinations. </p>
	  
    <p>Warm colors – such as red, yellow and orange – can spark a variety of emotions ranging from comfort and warmth to hostility and anger. Cool colors – such as green, blue and purple – often spark feelings of calmness as well as sadness.</p>

	<h2> A Brief History</h2>
	 <p> During the late seventeenth century, Sir Isaac Newton discovered the color spectrum and explored how each color is defined by a different wavelength of light. In 1704, Newton developed the color wheel. In the early twentieth century, Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung studied the effects of color on the human mind. Jung eventually developed a form of color therapy that allowed his patients to express themselves with colors and images. Today, color psychology is primarily used in marketing and advertising. </p>
