	 <p>Indigo is a creature of habit. This hue relishes tradition and doesn’t like to stray from its routine. This characteristic has led indigo to be rather predictable. You can rest assured that indigo will stick to what it knows. Since indigo isn’t spontaneous, it doesn’t appeal to people who fly by the seat of their pants.More often than not, indigo makes things bigger and scarier than they appear. It’s for this reason why indigo is notorious for its exaggerated feelings. If you feel overwhelmed in the presence of indigo, don’t let this color fool you. It tends to make a mountain out of a molehill.Though the world is evolving and growing more accepting, indigo is stuck in its ways. This color clings to the past, which is why it’s narrow-minded. Anything that indigo deems unconventional is regarded as immoral. After all, indigo doesn’t appreciate change. Indigo can be prejudiced against certain races, ethnicities, and genders, making it an intolerant color. The truth and indigo go hand in hand. In fact, sometimes indigo can be too candid. It’s an incredibly sincere hue, so you can trust that it means what it says. There’s nothing dishonest about indigo. It doesn’t deceive. Instead, it tells it like it is. If you’re in search of an honest opinion, look no further than indigo. There’s much to both love and hate about indigo. It’s knowledgable yet judgmental, uplifting yet bigoted, and kind yet dramatic.
